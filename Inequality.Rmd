# Inequality overview


## *Problem definition*
In the greater Otway region, 19% of people live in poverty and the median family income in Forrest is 55% lower than for the rest of Victoria (2016). Twenty percent of all families in Forrest are single-parent families (and all single parents are women). The SEIFA score (a measure of socio-economic conditions) puts Forrest in the 30% most disadvantaged areas in the country, and the 20% most disadvantaged in Victoria.

*Dynamic hypothesis:*
Intergenerational inequality is only one factor. Other contributing factors are income inequality, employment, the social gradient of health, housing stress, travel inequality, and internet access.


## *System conceptualisation and model formulation*
The inequality system is by nature both difficult to measure and multifaceted. To gauge the level of inequality in the Forrest system, we identified a range of contributing factors and normalised them, then took the arithmetic mean to arrive an an indicator value.


### Conceptual model
```{r, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(DiagrammeR)


mermaid("

A(Intergenerational inequality)-->D(Inequality indicator)

C(Unemployment)-->D(Inequality indicator)
E(Poverty)-->D(Inequality indicator)
F(Disability)-->D(Inequality indicator)
G(Housing stress)-->D(Inequality indicator)
H(Travel inequality)-->D(Inequality indicator)

["$3,000 or more"; M,F] = 0.0112, 0.0075  
Units: Dmnl  
Assumptions: Data from 2016 census, for weekly income. Disaggregated by gender - ABS only uses male and female for gender so is not comprehensive. Formulas above list [male, female]. See Github for data.

### inequality indicator

### intergenerational risk factor  

Type: Constant  
Formula: 1.8  
Units: structure/people  
Assumptions: @cobb-clarke_intergenerational_2017 estimate it is 1.8 times more likely for children of parents receiving long-term welfare to receive welfare themselves  

### normalised housing stress
