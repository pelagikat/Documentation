# Inequality overview


## *Problem definition*
In the greater Otway region, 19% of people live in poverty and the median family income in Forrest is 55% lower than for the rest of Victoria (2016). Twenty percent of all families in Forrest are single-parent families (and all single parents are women). The SEIFA score (a measure of socio-economic conditions) puts Forrest in the 30% most disadvantaged areas in the country, and the 20% most disadvantaged in Victoria.

*Dynamic hypothesis:*
Intergenerational inequality is only one factor. Other contributing factors are income inequality, employment, the social gradient of health, housing stress, travel inequality, and internet access.


## *System conceptualisation and model formulation*
The inequality system is by nature both difficult to measure and multifaceted. To gauge the level of inequality in the Forrest system, we identified a range of contributing factors and normalised them, then took the arithmetic mean to arrive an an indicator value.


### Conceptual model
```{r, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(DiagrammeR)


mermaid("

C(Unemployment)-->D(Inequality indicator)
E(Poverty)-->D(Inequality indicator)
F(Disability)-->D(Inequality indicator)
G(Housing stress)-->D(Inequality indicator)
H(Travel inequality)-->D(Inequality indicator)

## *Equations*
   
### disability fraction  

Type: Constant  
Formula: 0.177  
Units: Dmnl  
Assumptions: Data obtained from [https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/health/disability/disability-ageing-and-carers-australia-summary-findings/2018](Percentage of population who have a disability)  

### households without internet access fraction  

Type: Auxiliary  
Formula: 1-households with internet access fraction  
Units: Dmnl  
Assumptions: 1 minus the fraction of those with internet access (from Telecommunications)  

### income distribution by income cohort  

Type: Auxiliary
Formula: sum(income distribution fractions by income cohort and gender)  
Units: Dmnl  
Assumptions: This variable is split (subscripted) across 15 income cohorts (negative, nil, $1-$149, $150-$299, $300-$399, $400-$499, $500-$649, $650-$799, $800-$999, $1,000-$1,249, $1,250-$1,499, $1,250-$1,499, $1,750-$1,999, $2,000-$2,999, $3,000 or more) and summed over the two gender categories  

### income distribution fractions by income cohort and gender  

Type: Constant  
Formula: [Negative; M,F] = 0.006, 0.0022

Units: Dmnl  
Assumptions: Data from 2016 census, for weekly income. Disaggregated by gender - ABS only uses male and female for gender so is not comprehensive. Formulas above list [male, female]. See Github for data.
