# Climate change overview


## *Problem definition*

1. Human-induced climate change is a problem that will require a united, global effort to combat. However, the effects of climate change do and will continue to affect Forrest at a community level. Such affects include increasing temperatures, drying climates, increased and more serious bushfires, droughts, and more extreme weather. To remain safe and stay resilient in the face of climate change, Forrest must anticipate more frequent bushfires, flooding and drought, and develop plans for sustainable recovery.

*Dynamic hypothesis:*

Forrest is vulnerable to bushfires and drought, and the effect of climate change on biodiversity may begin to affect Forrest’s eco-tourism economy. Increasing temperatures will also affect Forrest’s residents, especially as the community is ageing. More frequent heatwaves will put older people, more susceptible to heat-induced illness, at risk. Forrest is occasionally subject to flooding (e.g. the spillover of Barwon Dam in 2012), and with the increase in extreme weather events this could become more frequent.



## *System conceptualisation*

There are three main drivers in the Climate Change component: bushfire, increasing temperatures, and flooding. 

### Bushfire
Bushfire is a complex phenomenon which is driven by many local scale factors. We have adapted the wildfire model from Collins et al. (2013) to model bushfire dynamics, and then built in an occurrence structure for regular bushfire and catastrophic bushfire. For regular bushfire, we modelled the joint occurrence of higher temperatures, lower rainfall, fires per year and relative fire intensity. For catastrophic bushfire, we assumed these same four inputs but with greater thresholds.

### Increasing temperature
Here we used a lookup table based upon the "temperature change from preindustrial" structure found in the FeliX model, with the BAU scenario, which assumes a temperature change of +1.85 degrees C by 2050.

### Flooding
Climate change is also predicted to increase flooding due to more intense rain events. Additionally, Forrest is close to and down slope from the West Barwon Dam. Here we assumed that rainfall in excess of the 95th percentile of historical data will result in flooding.

PhD/Data/Rainfall/rainfall.csv

### Visualise data
```{r}
library(readr)
rainfall <- read_csv("C:/Users/szeteyka/OneDrive - Deakin University/PhD/Data/Rainfall/rainfall.csv")
rainfall <- rainfall$Annual
is.numeric(rainfall)
summary(rainfall)

```{r}
library(readr)
daily_temp <- read_csv("C:/Users/szeteyka/OneDrive - Deakin University/PhD/Data/Temperature/daily_temp.csv")
```

### Visualise data
```{r}
daily_temp <- na.omit(daily_temp)
summer <- daily_temp[daily_temp$Month == 1 | daily_temp$Month == 2 | daily_temp$Month == 12, ]
hist(summer$max)
hist(daily_temp$max)

summary(summer$max)
summary(daily_temp$max)
quantile(summer$max, c(0.90))
```

### Fit data to distribution

```{r warning = FALSE}
library(fitdistrplus)
plotdist(summer$max, histo = TRUE, demp = TRUE)
plotdist(daily_temp$max)
descdist(summer$max, boot = 1000)
descdist(daily_temp$max, boot = 1000)
```
```{r warning = FALSE}
fw <- fitdist(summer$max, "weibull")
fw <- fitdist(daily_temp$max, "weibull")
summary(fw)
```

```{r}
fg <- fitdist(summer$max, "gamma")
fg <- fitdist(daily_temp$max, "gamma")
summary(fg)
```

```{r}
fln <- fitdist(summer$max, "lnorm")
fln <- fitdist(daily_temp$max, "lnorm")
summary(fln)

```

```{r}
par(mfrow = c(2, 2))
plot.legend <- c("Weibull", "lognormal", "gamma")
denscomp(list(fw, fln, fg), legendtext = plot.legend)
qqcomp(list(fw, fln, fg), legendtext = plot.legend)
cdfcomp(list(fw, fln, fg), legendtext = plot.legend)
ppcomp(list(fw, fln, fg), legendtext = plot.legend)
```
```{r warning = FALSE}



par(mfrow = c(1, 1))
library(actuar)
s.ll <- fitdist(summer$max, "llogis", start = list(shape = 1, scale = 500))
s.pr <- fitdist(summer$max, "pareto", start = list(shape = 1, scale = 500))
s.br <- fitdist(summer$max, "burr", start = list(shape1 = 0.3, shape2 = 1, rate = 1))
s.ll <- fitdist(daily_temp$max, "llogis", start = list(shape = 1, scale = 500))
s.pr <- fitdist(daily_temp$max, "pareto", start = list(shape = 1, scale = 500))
s.br <- fitdist(daily_temp$max, "burr", start = list(shape1 = 0.3, shape2 = 1, rate = 1))
cdfcomp(list(fln,s.ll, s.pr, s.br, fw, fg), xlogscale = TRUE, ylogscale = TRUE, 
        legendtext = c("lognormal", "loglogistic", "Pareto", "Burr", "Weibull", "gamma"))

```

```{r}
library(DescTools)

Gsd(daily_temp$max, na.rm = FALSE)

log(43.4) #ln max value

log(20.346) #ln geometric mean
log(16.64)
```


### Vensim

Best fit distribution to match summer temperature data is Burr, however Vensim does not have this distribution. Instead choose random lognormal.

General code for random lognormal: 
EXP(RANDOM NORMAL(-[something large], ln(max value), ln(geometric mean), geometric SD, 0)

EXP(RANDOM NORMAL(-6, 3.77, 3.013, 1.24, 0))



## Annual probability of bushfire in Otways
[Barwon South West bushfire risk modelling](https://www.ffm.vic.gov.au/fuel-management-report-2018-19/whats-happening-near-me/barwon-south-west-region)

![Bushfire risk profile Barwon South West](images/Bushfire_BSW.png)

### Vensim

Using the bushfire risk as at 2022 (51% if fuel reduction burns occur, 74% if not)
Rainfall distribution less than 1st quartile (681.9mm)
Temperature distribution greater than 90th percentile (28.3 °C)

(IF THEN ELSE(fuel reduction burning = 1, 0.51, 0.74))* (IF THEN ELSE( rainfall distribution < 682, 1, 0)) *(IF THEN ELSE( temperature distribution > 28.3, 1, 0))

## Annual probability of bushfire elsewhere in Victoria

[Statewide bushfire risk modelling](https://www.ffm.vic.gov.au/fuel-management-report-2018-19/statewide-achievements/bushfire-risk)

Using the bushfire risk as at 2022 (62% if fuel reduction burns occur, 80% if not)

### Vensim

IF THEN ELSE(fuel reduction burning > 0, 0.8, 0.62)

![Bushfire risk profile Victoria](images/Bushfire_statewide.png)

## Average annual visitor numbers

[Tourism data](https://www.tra.gov.au/Regional/local-government-area-profiles)

1,363,000 annual visitor nights spent in Colac Otway Shire in 2019

Assume one quarter of these visit Forrest (340,750).

Assume effect of bushfire will halve this (170,375)

Reduce by one quarter if fuel reduction burning = yes (85,187)

<span style="background-color: #FFFF00">Pollution of local waterbodies: ?</span> If waterbodies are polluted, the number of visitor nights reduced increases exponentially with the level of pollution.

### Vensim

(IF THEN ELSE(annual probability of bushfire in Otways > 0.5, 170375, 340750))-(IF THEN ELSE(fuel reduction burning = 1, 85187, 0))-(EXP(pollution of local waterbodies))

## Tourism income recovery rate

Visitor nights increase by one quarter if bushfire elsewhere = yes (85,187)

### Vensim

IF THEN ELSE(annual probability of bushfire elsewhere in Victoria > 0, 85187, 0)*143

## Tourism income inflow rate

If a catastrophic bushfire occurs, then all tourism will cease.

If not, then the tourism income will be number of visitor nights x $143 (total tourism spend per night)

### Vensim

IF THEN ELSE(probability of catastrophic bushfire = 1, 0, average annual visitor numbers*143)

## Loss of income from tourism

Initial value = one quarter of Colac Otway visitor nights (340,750) x spend per night ($143) 
= 48,727,250

### Vensim

INTEG(tourism income recovery rate - tourism income inflow rate)

## Impact of livestock on waterbodies

Use Nitrate + Nitrite as N (mg/L) as a proxy variable

### Vensim
Gamma is the closest distribution.

RANDOM GAMMA(0.002, 0.76, 1.1, 0.105, 0.137, 0)


## Pollution of local waterbodies

```{r}
library(readr)
nitrogen <- read_csv("C:/Users/szeteyka/OneDrive - Deakin University/PhD/Data/Water quality/Nitrogen.csv")
hist(nitrogen$Point)
summary(nitrogen$Point)
```

### Vensim

#IF THEN ELSE(impact of livestock on waterbodies > 0.1675 1, 0)

#0.1675 is 3rd quartile of turbidity dataset

Testing with IF THEN ELSE(impact of regenerative agriculture = 1, (impact of livestock on waterbodies) *0.5, impact of livestock on waterbodies)


## Probability of catstrophic bushfire

[Victorian Auditor General's Report: Reducing Bushfire Risks, October 2020](https://www.audit.vic.gov.au/report/reducing-bushfire-risks)

DELWP modelling for Fire Danger Index (FDI) 130 (Black Saturday occurred under FDI 130)

Severe drought: set rainfall to be <10th decile

Extreme temperature: set temperature to be >= 40° C

Additional factors in Black Saturday were relative humidity <10% and strong to gale-force winds - not modelling this for now.

```{r}
library(readr)
rainfall <- read_csv("C:/Users/szeteyka/OneDrive - Deakin University/PhD/Data/Rainfall/rainfall.csv")
rainfall <- rainfall$Annual

quantile(rainfall, c(0.10))

```


### Vensim

IF THEN ELSE( temperature distribution >= 40, 1, 0)* IF THEN ELSE( rainfall distribution <599.63, 1, 0) *IF THEN ELSE(fuel reduction burning = 0, 1, 0)

## Annual probability of flooding

[Floodplain management in Colac Otway Shire](https://www.ccmaknowledgebase.vic.gov.au/flood/resources/Colac%20Otway%20Shire_Brochure.pdf)

Forrest is in an area with a 1% AEP.

Annual Exceedance Probability (AEP): A flood with a 1% AEP has a one in a hundred chance of being exceeded in any year.

### Vensim

0.01 floods/year

## Rate of land use change

### Data used
[Victoria's Land Use Cover Time Series](https://www.environment.vic.gov.au/biodiversity/Victorias-Land-Cover-Time-Series)

Using Otway Ranges bioregion data (Forrest is on the edge of the Otway Ranges and Otway Plain bioregions)

Take geometric mean of percentage land use change. Use formula as per [Habib (2012)](https://www.arpapress.com/Volumes/Vol11Issue3/IJRRAS_11_3_08.pdf) to include zero and negative values.

```{r}
# vector of percentage land use change in Otway Ranges bioregion between 1985-2019
luc <- c(-54, 71, -38, -11, -64, 259, 11, 52, 0, -58, -42, 0, -83, -19, 6, 250, -78, -58)

# vector of hectare land use change in Otway Ranges bioregion between 1985-2019
#luc <- c(-1, 136, -2, -1527, -1, 409, 479, 94, 0, -194, -94, 601, -10, -33, -33, 0, -121, -40)

# extract negative values
luc.neg <- luc[luc < 0]
# extract positive values
luc.pos <- luc[luc > 0]
# extract zero values
luc.0 <- luc[luc = 0]
# take absolute value of negative values
luc.neg.abs <- abs(luc.neg)

library(DescTools)
# Take geometric mean G_pos
G_pos <- Gmean(luc.pos)
# Take geometric mean G_neg
G_neg <- Gmean(luc.neg.abs)
# Geometric mean of negative values G_neg = -G_|-(luc.neg)|
G_neg <- -(G_neg)
G_neg  
# Geometric mean of zero values (for completeness)
G_0 <- 0

N <- length(luc)  
N_pos <- length(luc.pos)
N_neg <- length(luc.neg)
N_0 <- length(luc.0)
N
N_pos
N_neg
N_0

# Overall geometric mean is weighted average (sum?)

GM <- ((N_pos/N)*G_pos) + ((N_neg/N)*G_neg) + ((N_0/N)*G_0)
GM
```

## Impact of regenerative agriculture

Testing this variable with a binomial distribution, with P = 0.5 (e.g. regen agriculture either yes or no). Will likely need to modify this, perhaps to a(n increasing?) distribution with percentage of farms converted.
