# Infrastructure Overview

The Forrest community have four major infrastructure projects currently in train which they have identified as being important for the future development and growth of Forrest. There is one additional project which is as important for the community but not reliant on outside intervention.

## *Problem definition*
1. In the past, on-site septic systems were adequate for a town the size of Forrest, which did not have many visitors. With the change to a tourism economy, there are many more people that come to town, particularly for events, and the now ageing septic infrastructure requires upgrading. The limits of septic infrastructure for waste are hindering attempts to increase housing in the town. Studies have been undertaken by Barwon Water to upgrade wastewater infrastructure but there has been no progress, partly due to funding issues. The current option on the table expects the community to contribute, which may delay or entirely derail the development.

*Dynamic hypothesis:*
Ageing septic systems that donâ€™t meet current safety standards are no longer adequate and new infrastructure is urgently needed. This affects the local environment and biodiversity, the local economy (by limiting tourism), health of local residents, and additional development in the town.

2. The Forrest MTB Trails were first opened in 2005, encompassing over 60km of trails. A proposal was released in December 2019 to increase the MTB trail network by approximately 38kms, including restructuring the existing trails and creating a new Trail Head. This plan is aimed to revitalise mountain bike tourism and re-establish Forrest as a nationally significant mountain bike destination.

*Dynamic hypothesis:*
Mountain bike trails in Forrest are already a major tourism drawcard but upgrades to the trail network would encourage more visitation to the town. This is a benefit to the tourism economy but issues still remain around accommodation (i.e. housing supply) and wastewater.

3. The Forrest Common is a piece of public land which could be put to better use for the community. After several years of consultation with Colac Otway Shire, a plan has been approved but it is beyond the ability of Council to fund.

*Dynamic hypothesis:*
A revamped Forrest Common would benefit tourism and in-migration of families (due to new play equipment).

4. The community identified that a bushfire safer place is necessary for the community, and that one of the DELWP parcels of land could be used to achieve this. A feasibility study and preliminary plans have been completed, but funding needs to be found to build it.

*Dynamic hypothesis:*
If funding can be obtained for the Gateway to The Otways Centre, this would have a positive impact on community health and wellbeing in the event of a bushfire and potentially prevent loss of life.



## *System conceptualisation*


### Conceptual model
```{r, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(DiagrammeR)

grViz("
digraph {
  graph[layout = dot, rankdir = LR]
  node[shape = box, fontname = Arial]
  'Funding'; 'Build in progress'; 'Completed infrastructure'

  node[shape = oval, fontname = Arial]
  'Time delay'

  # edge statements
  'Funding'->'Build in progress' 'Build in progress'->'Completed infrastructure'
  'Time delay'->'Funding' 'Time delay'->'Build in progress'
 
}
")

```




## *Model formulation*

## *Equations*



## Second CFA Truck

The community are raising funds for the CFA truck themselves so it is not reliant on outside funding. Thus it is not dependent on the funding scenarios and funding allocation rate. 

### Unit cost of CFA truck

Type: constant  
Formula: 350,000  
Units: dollar/asset component  
Assumption: one new CFA truck costs $350,000.  <p style="background-color:yellow;">Clarifying with Pete/Emma Ashton.</p>

### Second CFA truck funding

Type: constant  
Formula: 350,000  
Units: dollars/year  
Assumption: It will take 1 year to raise all the money required. <p style="background-color:yellow;">Clarifying with Pete/Emma Ashton.</p> 

### second CFA truck funding lag

Type: constant  
Formula: 1  
Units: years  
Assumption: It will take 1 year to raise all the money required  

### second CFA truck build delay

Type: constant  
Formula: 0.5  
Units: years  
Assumption: It will take 0.5 years from ordering to delivery (ie build time)  

### Second CFA truck construction rate

Type: rate  
Formula: DELAY1( second CFA truck funding/unit cost of CFA truck, second CFA truck build delay+second CFA truck funding lag)  
Units: asset component/year  
Assumption: The input is the number of asset components per year, the delay is the funding lag plus the build delay  

***

## Gateway to the Otways Centre

The community want to use the former DELWP land on Grant St to build a new, state-of-the-art bushfire place of last resort. This building would also become a multi-purpose community centre and possibly have some function for tourism or conference facilities.  


### GTOC funding approved

Type: auxilliary
Formula: IF THEN ELSE(funding scenario=1, 1.2e+07 , 0 )  
Units: dollars  
Assumption: The cost of building GTOC is $12,000,000  

### Gateway to the Otways Centre Funding

Type: stock  
Formula: INTEG(-GTOC funding allocation rate, GTOC funding approved)  
Units: dollars  
Assumption:   

### GTOC funding duration

Type: constant  
Formula: 2  
Units: years  
Assumption: The funding will continue for the same time as the build time  

### GTOC funding allocation rate

Type: Rate  
Formula: Gateway to the Otways Centre Funding/GTOC funding duration  
Units: dollars/year  
Assumption: The project is fully funded


### unit cost of GTOC

Type: constant
Formula: 1,200,000   
Units: dollars per asset component  
Assumption: Have arbitrarily assumed that the GTOC has 10 asset components (or 'build stages')
