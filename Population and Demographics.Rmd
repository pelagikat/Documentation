# Population and Demographics overview

Forrest has been a regional Victorian township since 1890 and developed around the railway built to transport Otway timber and produce. The population has waxed and waned with its timber and forestry activities, at a peak in the 1960s. With tourism having replaced forestry as the primary economic activity in Forrest, this too may result in volatility in population (especially with the impact on tourism from the Covid-19 pandemic).

## *Problem definition*

1. Between 2006 and 2016, Forrest experienced a 35% increase in population. Over that time, the number of children aged 0-14 decreased by 14% and people over 55 increased by 26%. The median age of a person living in Forrest has increased from 41 to 52. Forrest has a slowly increasing and ageing population, which will influence the needs of residents in the future.

*Dynamic hypothesis:*
The population in Forrest is ageing due to in-migration of couples without children, and out-migration of young people for school and work after they finish high school. It is limited by housing availability and a lack of diversity in job opportunities.

2. With Forrest Primary School being the central school, pre-school, and childcare service for the community and neighbouring townships, it creates traffic for local businesses in town. It also works with many of the community groups in Forrest. If Forrest were to lose its primary school, there would be many negative knock-on effects causing harm to Forrestâ€™s future, such as out-migration of families seeking access to closer schools.

*Dynamic hypothesis:*
The location of the primary school in Forrest makes it a central hub for the neighbouring communities. This brings in regular visitation from people outside of the township who may then go and patronise local businesses. If the school were to close, this regular visitation would likely slow down or cease, and have effects upon those businesses.

# Data for population taken from ABS census data for Forrest as a State Suburb

a = c(170, 45, 106, 20)
b = c(238, 40, 165, 35)
c = c(230, 28, 158, 45)

df <- data.frame(row.names = c("Total", "0-14", "15-64", "65+"), "2006" = a, "2011" = b, "2016" = c)
df <- do.call(rbind, df)
df

pop <- barplot(df, beside = TRUE, main = "Population change in Forrest 2006-2016", 
               names.arg = c("Total", "0-14", "15-64", "65+"), ylim = c(0, 250), ylab = "Population", 
               col = c("#E69F00", "#56B4E9", "#009E73"))
legend("topright", legend = c("2006", "2011", "2016"), 
       fill = c("#E69F00", "#56B4E9", "#009E73"))


```

## *System conceptualisation*

The population of Forrest is not large (230 at the 2016 Census) and is easiest to split into three main cohorts: children (0-15), adults (16-64), and retirees (65+).

Each of these cohorts has a migration and death rate specific to that cohort. There are ageing (maturation) rates between the 0-14 and 15-64 cohorts. 

Migration rates for each cohort are influenced by different characteristics, some of which are modelled (e.g. job availability and housing) and some which are not but are captured within a reference (i.e. initial) migration rate.

School enrolments are made up of local children aged 4-10 (half of the 0-14 cohort) and from 'district' children (i.e., from surrounding townships that make up "Forrest and District").

### Conceptual model

```



## *Model formulation*

The structure of this model component was based upon the model by @navarro_rusem_2019. Additional structure was added to incorporate the local school model within this component, and for the different effects on migration rate.

## Data sources

[Data for births.](https://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/DetailsPage/3301.02018?OpenDocument) We used data for the Colac Otway LGA.

Census data for Forrest available [here.](https://www.abs.gov.au/websitedbs/D3310114.nsf/Home/2016%20QuickStats) Data for Forrest as a distinct location is only available for 2006, 2011 and 2016 censuses.

Data for deaths was obtained from ABS.stat, which has now been decommissioned and replaced by [ABS Data Explorer.](https://explore.data.abs.gov.au/) For death rates we had to use state-level data as this was the only way to get age-disaggregated death data.

Units: Dmnl  
Assumptions/data: As demand goes up, supply goes down and the ratio also goes down, and the prices go up.
Additionally, if the housing supply/demand ratio is less than 1, then there aren't enough houses available for new families to move in unless existing families move out, so the effect of housing on net migration is zero (this also affects all other effect variables on migration).

### cohort time  

Type: Constant  
Formula: 7  
Units: Dmnl  
Assumptions/data: To prevent 're-enrolment' of the same student each year, divide the cohort values by 7 so each enrolment is new.
