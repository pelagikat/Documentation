# Telecommunications overview


## *Problem definition*
The NBN has been rolled out in Forrest, but the service can be poor. NBN Fixed Wireless is known to suffer from congestion issues, and the distance to the fixed wireless tower can also affect internet speeds. The nearest tower to Forrest is in Barwon Downs, and towers have an effective range of 14kms, which can be disrupted by terrain (trees, mountains, etc.), and precipitation. There is also limited mobile reception throughout Forrest.

*Dynamic hypothesis:* Poor internet and mobile phone service impacts establishment of new businesses and growth of existing ones. Improved internet access (fixed and mobile) would encourage new businesses which rely on connectivity, and better support the existing residents and businesses. It is also necessary for education and better health outcomes.


## *System conceptualisation*

We are only considering Fixed Wireless NBN in our model. We wish to explore how internet demand, infrastructure (in the form of Fixed Wireless towers) and internet capacity interact in Forrest. There are a number of assumptions made on limited data for some of these variables as much of the information underlying the NBN is commercial-in-confidence.

### Conceptual model
```{r, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(DiagrammeR)

grViz("
digraph {
  graph[layout = dot, rankdir = TB]
  node[shape = box, fontname = Arial]
  'Internet service demand'; 'Fixed wireless towers'; 'Internet service capacity'

  node[shape = oval, fontname = Arial]
  'Business demand'; 'Residential demand'

  # edge statements
  'Business demand'->'Internet service demand' 'Residential demand'->'Internet service demand'
  'Internet service capacity'->'Internet service demand' 'Internet service demand'->'Fixed wireless towers'
  'Fixed wireless towers'->'Internet service capacity'
 
}
")

```

## *Model formulation*

There are three stocks with inflow rates forming the basis of the model: Internet Service Demand, Fixed Wireless Towers, and Internet Service Capacity. Demand is influenced by business and residential internet demand. Capacity is influenced by demand, user limits and speeds per connection. Fixed wireless towers is influenced by oversubscription of the existing infrastructure (i.e. how far the capacity exceeds the user limit). We have not modelled infrastructure funding in this case, as NBN Co is supposed to roll out upgrades according to need (although this is intermittent currently), and it is funded by the Federal Government.

Census data for Forrest available [here.](https://www.abs.gov.au/websitedbs/D3310114.nsf/Home/2016%20QuickStats) Data for Forrest as a distinct location is only available for 2006, 2011 and 2016 censuses.

Data was obtained from Australian Bureau of Statistics

## *Equations*

### business internet demand

Type: Auxiliary  
Formula: "number of businesses (agriculture)" + "number of businesses (other)" + "number of businesses (tourism)"  
Units: structure  
Assumptions: Assume that all businesses require a connection to the internet  
    
### demand per location

Type: Constant  
Formula: 1  
Units: connections/structure  
Assumptions: 1 connections per location  

### Fixed wireless tower investment rate

Type: Auxiliary (rate)  
Formula: tower oversubscription factor / Time  
Units: tower/Year  
Assumptions:  

### Fixed Wireless Towers

Type: Stock  
Formula: INTEG ( INTEGER(Fixed wireless tower investment rate)), INITIAL = INIT number of towers  
Units: tower  
Assumptions:  

### fixed wireless user limit  

Type: Constant  
Formula: 60  
Units: connections/tower  
Assumptions: This value was difficult to ascertain, however [this article](https://www.itnews.com.au/news/nbn-co-cuts-average-number-of-users-per-wireless-cell-to-19-559707) quoted NBN Co saying they had reduced users from historical levels of 60 per cell to an average of 19. Based upon that, we assume 60 connections is higher than acceptable and have set that as the maximum value.  

### households with internet access fraction  

Type: Constant  
Formula: 0.77  
Units: fraction  
Assumptions: From ABS 2016 census data: 77% of households accessed the internet from their home  

### INIT NBN connections

Type: Constant  
Formula: 114 + 27  
Units: connections  
Assumptions: 77% of 148 dwellings (from 2016 ABS Census data) plus 27 businesses (from 2020 ABS counts of businesses). See Github for data.  

### INIT number of towers  

Type: Constant  
Formula: 1  
Units: tower  
Assumptions: There is one fixed wireless tower in Forrest  

### internet capacity demand

Type: Auxiliary  
Formula: Internet Service Demand * maximum speed per connection / Fixed Wireless Towers  
Units: Mbps * connection/tower  
Assumptions: This is a variable which represents the total amount of traffic demand as a proportion of number of towers.  

### internet capacity discrepancy

Type: Auxiliary  
Formula: internet capacity demand-Internet Service Capacity  
Units: Mbps*connection/tower  
Assumptions: This is the discrepancy between capacity demand and capacity actual.  

### Internet Service Capacity

Type: Stock  
Formula: INTEG ( Internet service capacity rate), INITIAL = maximum speed per connection * fixed wireless user limit  
Units: Mbps * connections/tower  
Assumptions: The initial value is the maximum available capacity  

### Internet service capacity rate

Type: Auxiliary  
Formula: IF THEN ELSE ( tower oversubscription factor <= Fixed Wireless Towers, internet capacity discrepancy / Time, (fixed wireless user limit * maximum speed per connection) / Time)    
Units: Mbps * connection /(Year * tower)  
Assumptions: If the tower oversubscription factor is less than the number of towers (i.e., there are enough towers), then the discrepancy structure will be valid. However, if there are not enough towers to meet demand, then the capacity rate will stay at its max level, which is the user limit * max speed per connection.  

### Internet Service Demand

Type: Stock  
Formula: INTEG ( Internet service demand rate ), INITIAL = INIT NBN connections  
Units: connections  
Assumptions: 

### Internet service demand rate

Type: Auxiliary (rate)  
Formula: (business internet demand + residential internet demand) * demand per location / Time  
Units: connections/Year  
Assumptions: Assume that all businesses require a connection to the internet  

###  internet service performance

Type: Auxiliary  
Formula: Internet Service Capacity / Internet Service Demand  
Units: Mbps/tower  
Assumptions: This is the equivalent of a supply/demand ratio  

### max number of premises to connect to the internet

Type: Constant  
Formula: Residential Housing + Tourism Housing   
Units: structure  
Assumptions:  

### maximum speed per connection

Type: Constant  
Formula: 75  
Units: Mbps  
Assumptions: Fixed wireless has a maximum plan speed of 75Mbps  

### residential internet demand

Type: Auxiliary  
Formula: max number of premises to connect to the internet * households with internet access fraction  
Units: structure  
Assumptions:  

### tower build delay time  

Type: Constant  
Formula: 2  
Units: Year  
Assumptions: Assume it takes two years to build  

### tower investment responsiveness

Type: Constant  
Formula: 0  
Units: Dmnl  
Assumptions: This variable represents whether or not a new tower is built when it is oversubscribed. Currently a binary (yes/no; 0/1) but can be modified to be an investment delay  

### tower oversubscription factor

Type: Auxiliary  
Formula: INIT number of towers + (Internet Service Demand / fixed wireless user limit) - Fixed Wireless Towers  
Units: tower  
Assumptions: Desired state of system  (Initial number of towers plus the number mandated by the demand)
