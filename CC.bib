	abstract = {Fire danger indices are an important tool for fire and land managers. This study examines two fire danger indices developed for use in Australian forests, the Forest Fire Danger Index and the Forest Fire Behaviour Tables, and a third, the Fire Weather Index, which was developed for use in Canadian pine forests but is finding use in other countries. The indices are described and their structures examined by comparing the response of each index to wind, fuel moisture, and fuel availability. The application of the indices is examined by comparing their predictions across a range of wind, fuel moisture, and fuel availability conditions, and in a case study using weather station data. The three systems are found to have similar structures but to provide widely varying assessments of fire danger for a given set of inputs. In the case study, differences between how weather variables are incorporated by the indices cancelled out some of the differences in structure and the results were in closer agreement, particularly for the two systems developed for eucalypt forest.},

	abstract = {The work of the Group on Earth Observation (GEO) is perceived as instrumental to attain sustainable dEvelopment goals and to be a major driver of how the society-technology-environment system is managed. However, appropriate scientific methodologies to assess the benefits of the Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS) and validate investments in Earth observation infrastrucure have been missing. This paper presents a systems approach to measure and analyze the impact oF Glbal Earth Observation across the nine Societal Benefit Areas defined by GEO. The methodological framework presented here was developed and applied to be complete across space, time and sectors through Integration and aggregation. Apart from the general assessment framework, we present some speciFics of the numerical tool, which is based on System Dynamics modeling and simulation technique. Our results indicate that through the total system benefits are strongly policy dependent, improvements of GEOSS per se and data availability and interoperability, the accrued benefits are large and have a great potential shaping mankind's course to sustainability.},
