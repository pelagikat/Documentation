# Land Use Overview

There are four major types of land use in Forrest: Agriculture (incorporating crop farming and livestock farming), Housing, Forest, and Protected (national park). As an initial condition, we assume that agricultural land which is >40 hectares in size is classified as Farming Zone, and is thus protected from land use change (although the Forrest community would like this zoning modified so that Farming Zone land within the township could have more than one residence built on it). Housing land is primarily within the township. [This link](https://www.planning.vic.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0027/97182/PPN42-Applying-the-Rural-Zones_June-2015.pdf) discusses the different rural planning zones.

## *Problem definition*
1. Agricultural land fertility is a driver of agricultural business profits. In general, the world needs to use less additional fertilisers to improve the health of ecosystems. Forrest is a hub for regenerative agriculture – where the land is improved as a result of agriculture, rather than stripped of nutrients as in traditional farming.

*Dynamic hypothesis:*
Regenerative agriculture limits the use of fertilisers, which reduces agricultural runoff into waterways, improving local water quality and the environment generally. It also boosts agricultural profits.

2. There is not currently a great deal of land use change in Forrest. Agricultural businesses and housing demand are the greatest pressures on land use.

*Dynamic hypothesis:*
Residents have suggested petitioning Council to change the laws restricting multiple buildings on agricultural land (the ‘40ha’ rule), which may increase land transfer between ag and housing, and an increase in agricultural business may increase land transfer between bush and agriculture.


## *System conceptualisation*

The stock of land in Forrest is fixed (approx 12,000 hectares). We assume four land use types - Agriculture, Forest, Housing and Protected. Protected land can only be increased from Forest land, and once it is there it remains there. Housing can be increased from Agriculture or Farming but once land is Housing land, it remains there. Agriculture and Forest land can cycle between the two.

Housing land has pressures from housing demand. Agriculture land has pressure from agricultural businesses. 

Fertilisation intensity and consumption does not affect the rest of the model.  


## *Model formulation*

The land use component was inspired by the FeliX model @rydzak_felix3_2013. There are four stocks, one for each of the land use types, and a small structure to model fertiliser consumption. Another small structure is present to set maximum values for each land use stock. Each transfer rate between land stocks is affected by two variables: a 'change' variable (FeliX characterises this as a value which measures the 'need' for change between land use types, so we represent this as a pressure for change); and an 'allocation time' variable, which represents the amount of time it takes to change from one land use to another.  

## Data sources

Data and code are available at [https://github.com/pelagikat/Local-SDGs-systems-model](https://github.com/pelagikat/Local-SDGs-systems-model)

Land use data was obtained from the [Victorian Land Use Information System (VLUIS)](http://vro.agriculture.vic.gov.au/dpi/vro/vrosite.nsf/pages/vluis). This is a series of seven spatial datasets with land use classes which we clipped to the extent of the Forrest township. The land use classes were categorised into the model variables as follows:

Housing:  
Detached Home  
Residential Rural / Rural Lifestyle (0.4 to 20 Ha)  
Vacant Residential Home Site / Surveyed Lot  
Vacant Residential Rural / Rural Lifestyle (0.4 to 20ha)  

Forest:  
Creek Reserve (Fresh Water)  
Forest Reserves - Public  
Reserved Land  
Softwood Plantation  
Nature Reserve Area 
Water Supply  
Unclassified Private Land  
Native Hardwood (standing timber)  

Agriculture:  
Mixed farming and grazing  (generally more than 20ha)  
Livestock Production (Dairy Cattle)  
Livestock Production (Beef Cattle)  
Market Garden - Vegetables (generally less than 20ha plantings)  

Protected:  
National Park - Land  
Conservation Area - Public
