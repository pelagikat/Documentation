# Biodiversity overview


## *Problem definition*
Forrest is located in a biodiversity hotspot, and the Great Otway National Park provides protection for some of that biodiversity. The local residents are proud of their pristine surroundings and dedicated to ensuring they remain so. Climate change and potential bushfire impact are both threats to the local environment, as well as any land use change which reduces the amount of bushland. Fertiliser runoff from agriculture is also a potential danger.

*Dynamic hypothesis:*
Climate change and land use change are the fundamental drivers for biodiversity risk. They both increases bushfire risk and land use change reduces habitat. Indigenous cultural burning may be a way to mitigate biodiversity loss (by healing Country) but has a significant lead-in/preparation time. 



## *System conceptualisation and model formulation*

```{r}
library(DiagrammeR)

grViz("
digraph boxes_and_circles {
  graph[overlap = true, fontsize = 10]
  node[shape = box, fontname = Arial]
  A; B; C

  node[shape = circle, fixedsize = true, width = 0.9]
  1; 2; 3; 4; 5

  # edge statements
  1->A 2->A A->B B->C
  3->C 4->C 5-C

}
")

```


Species richness is the critical variable in the biodiversity component. Species richness can be affected by cultural burning, land use change, invasive species and climate change. Land use change is modelled using a species area curve, 
$$
S = cA^z 
$$

where Z = 0.86 (derived from data), A = land area, c - constant, and S = number of species.

Data are available at [https://github.com/pelagikat/Local-SDGs-systems-model](https://github.com/pelagikat/Local-SDGs-systems-model)
Thanks to Carla Archibald for assisting with data for this model component.

## *Equations*

### baseline invasive species impact

Type: Auxiliary  
Formula: INIT species richness - (0.21*INIT species richness)  
Units: species  
Assumptions: 21% species richnesss decline compared to natural systems; @crystal-ornelas_cumulative_2020  

### fire impact on biodiversity  

Type: Auxiliary  
Formula: 1 + (1 - (1/FFDI model))  
Units: Dmnl  
Assumptions:  

### impact of climate damage on biodiversity  

Type: Auxiliary  
Formula: 1 + 0.00091  
Units: Dmnl  
Assumptions: Climate damage for Forrest area from LUTO model. Land suitable for biodiversity reduces by 10% between 1990 and 2100, therefore annualised reduction is 9.1e-4 %  

### impact of cultural burning on biodiversity  

Type: Auxiliary  
Formula: 1+Cultural Burning  
Units: Dmnl  
Assumptions: In personal discussions with an Australian fire researcher, they suggested that cultural burning would have a positive impact on biodiversity compared with a fire suppression regime (business as usual). Some evidence provided by @bowman_human_2011, @trauernicht_local_2015.

### INIT species richness  

Type: Constant  
Formula: 4637  
Units: species  
Assumptions: Baseline 1990 data for species richness in the Colac Otway LGA area. Includes amphibians, birds, mammals, plants and reptiles. See Github for spatial data. 

### invasive species impact discrepancy  

Type: Auxiliary  
Formula: Species richness-baseline invasive species impact  
Units: species  
Assumptions:  

### land for biodiversity impact  

Type: Auxiliary  
Formula: Forest Land + Protected Land  
Units: hectares  
Assumptions: Agricultural land has no biodiversity impact  

### land use change impact on biodiversity  

Type: Auxiliary  
Formula: (species area curve coefficient * land for biodiversity impact ^ species area curve exponent) / simulation time  
Units: species/Year  
Assumptions: Species area curve S = cA^z , z = 0.86 (derived from data). Assume that species richness initial variable is 50% of total c = 2 Area = 8375 S = 4637  

### species area curve coefficient  

Type: Constant  
Formula: 2  
Units: species/hectares  
Assumptions: as derived in *land use change impact on biodiversity*  

### species area curve exponent  

Type: Constant  
Formula: 0.86  
Units: Dmnl  
Assumptions: derived from data  

### Species richness  

Type: Stock  
Formula: INTEG (Species richness increase rate - Species richness decrease rate), INITIAL = INIT species richness)  
Units: species  
Assumptions:  

### Species richness decrease rate=

Type: Auxiliary  
Formula: (impact of climate damage on biodiversity) * (invasive species impact discrepancy / simulation time) * fire impact on biodiversity  
Units: species/Year  
Assumptions:  

### Species richness increase rate  

Type: Auxiliary  
Formula: impact of cultural burning on biodiversity * land use change impact on biodiversity  
Units: species/Year  
Assumptions:
