# Land Use Overview

There are three major types of land use in Forrest: Agriculture (incorporating crop farming and livestock farming), Housing, and Bush/Forest. There is protected National Park land which will not leave the Bush/Forest stock. As an initial condition, we assume that agricultural land which is >40 hectares in size is classified as Farming Zone, and is thus protected from land use change (although the Forrest community would like this zoning modified so that Farming Zone land within the township could have more than one residence built on it). Housing land is primarily within the township. [This link](https://www.planning.vic.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0027/97182/PPN42-Applying-the-Rural-Zones_June-2015.pdf) discusses the different rural planning zones.

## Stock variables

### Agricultural Land

Formula: INTEG (  "Bush-Agriculture transfer rate" 
                  - "Agricultural-Housing transfer rate")  
INIT: INIT Agricultural land  
Units: hectares  
Assumptions: Total agricultural land  

### Bush/Forest Land

Formula: INTEG ( "Bush-Agriculture transfer rate" 
                  - "Bush-Housing transfer rate")  
INIT: "INIT Bush/Forest land"  
Units: hectares  
Assumptions: Total Bush/Forest land. We are including forestry plantation in this stock.  

### Housing Land

Formula: INTEG (  "Agricultural-Housing transfer rate" 
                  + "Bush-Housing transfer rate")  
INIT: INIT Housing Land  
Units: hectares  
Assumptions: Total Housing land  

### Forest Protected Land

Formula: INTEG (  Forest Protected Land Change )  
INIT: INIT Forest Protected Land  
Units: hectares  
Assumptions: National Park area will remain protected over time  

### Fertilisation Intensity

Formula: INTEG ( Fertilisation Intensity Change )  
INIT: INIT Fertilisation Intensity  
Units: TonNutrient/(ha*Year)  
Assumptions: Intensity of fertilisation practices per ha per year. Unchanged from FeliX.

## Rate variables

### Bush-Agriculture transfer rate

Formula: MAX ( 0, 
             Bush Agriculture change 
                  * ( "Bush/Forest Land" 
                       - Forest Protected Land ) 
                  / ( Bush to Agriculture land allocation time ) )
             + MIN ( 0, 
                  Bush Agriculture change 
                       * ( Agricultural Land 
                            - Agriculture Protected Land ) 
                       / Agriculture to Bush land allocation time )  
Units: ha/Year  
Assumptions: Currently assuming negligible change between these stocks, but may not be accurate  

### Agriculture-Housing transfer rate

Formula: MAX ( 0, 
             "Agriculture-Housing change" 
                  * ( Agricultural Land 
                       - Agriculture Protected Land ) 
                  / Agriculture to Housing land allocation time )    
Units: ha/Year  
Assumptions: This will likely be the most influential in Forrest. The 40-ha rule variable will affect this.  

### Bush-Housing transfer rate

Formula: MAX ( 0, 
             "Bush-Housing change" 
                  * ( "Bush/Forest Land" 
                       - Forest Protected Land ) 
                  / Bush to Housing land allocation time )  
Units: ha/Year
Assumptions: Currently assuming negligible change between these stocks, but may not be accurate  

### Forest Protected Land Change

Formula: DELAY3 ( Forest Protected Land 
                  * Current to Max Forest Protected Land , 
             Time to Adjust Forest Protected Land )  
Units: ha/Year  
Assumptions: Unmodified from FeliX  

### Fertilsation Intensity Change

Formula: Fertilisation Intensity 
             * Current to Max Fertilisation Intensity 
             / Time to Adjust Fertilisation Intensity  
Units: TonNutrient/(Year*Year*ha)  
Assumptions: Unmodified from FeliX
