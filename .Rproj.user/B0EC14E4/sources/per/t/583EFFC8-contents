# Infrastructure Overview

The Forrest community have four major infrastructure projects currently in train which they have identified as being important for the future development and growth of Forrest. There is one additional project which is as important for the community but not reliant on outside intervention.

## *Problem definition*



## *System conceptualisation*



## *Model formulation*



## *Equations*



## Second CFA Truck

The community are raising funds for the CFA truck themselves so it is not reliant on outside fuding. Thus it is not dependent on the funding scenarios and funding allocation rate. 

### Unit cost of CFA truck

Type: constant  
Formula: 350,000  
Units: dollar/asset component  
Assumption: one new CFA truck costs $350,000.  <p style="background-color:yellow;">Clarifying with Pete/Emma Ashton.</p>

### Second CFA truck funding

Type: constant  
Formula: 350,000  
Units: dollars/year  
Assumption: It will take 1 year to raise all the money required. <p style="background-color:yellow;">Clarifying with Pete/Emma Ashton.</p> 

### second CFA truck funding lag

Type: constant  
Formula: 1  
Units: years  
Assumption: It will take 1 year to raise all the money required  

### second CFA truck build delay

Type: constant  
Formula: 0.5  
Units: years  
Assumption: It will take 0.5 years from ordering to delivery (ie build time)  

### Second CFA truck construction rate

Type: rate  
Formula: DELAY1( second CFA truck funding/unit cost of CFA truck, second CFA truck build delay+second CFA truck funding lag)  
Units: asset component/year  
Assumption: The input is the number of asset components per year, the delay is the funding lag plus the build delay

## Gateway to the Otways Centre

The community want to use the former DELWP land on Grant St to build a new, state-of-the-art bushfire place of last resort. This building would also become a multi-purpose community centre and possibly have some function for tourism or conference facilities.  


### GTOC funding approved

Type: auxilliary
Formula: IF THEN ELSE(funding scenario=1, 1.2e+07 , 0 )  
Units: dollars  
Assumption: The cost of building GTOC is $12,000,000  

### Gateway to the Otways Centre Funding

Type: stock  
Formula: INTEG(-GTOC funding allocation rate, GTOC funding approved)  
Units: dollars  
Assumption:   

### GTOC funding duration

Type: constant  
Formula: 2  
Units: years  
Assumption: The funding will continue for the same time as the build time  

### GTOC funding allocation rate

Type: Rate  
Formula: Gateway to the Otways Centre Funding/GTOC funding duration  
Units: dollars/year  
Assumption: The project is fully funded


### unit cost of GTOC

Type: constant
Formula: 1,200,000   
Units: dollars per asset component  
Assumption: Have arbitrarily assumed that the GTOC has 10 asset components (or 'build stages')
